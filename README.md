# Digit-Recogniser
Starting Small <br>
An easiest model inspired from the Tensorflow tutorial of Deep Learning Specialisation of Prof. Andrew Ng. <br>
The initial model had Layer 1 of 20 nodes, Layer 2 of 10 nodes followed by softmax layer of 5 nodes. <br>
After tweaking the number of layers to 64-24-10, the acuracy given was about 0.997 and accuracy on test data was about 0.95
Next chosen number of nodes in layers changes to 256-32-10, which gave train accuracy 0.9995 and on test data gives 0.97

This shows how important the network structure is for getting good accuracy.
